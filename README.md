# About me
- I'm a software engineer who focus on contributing high quality code.
    - Balance DRY and code duplication. Code duplication is good if it was put on the right place.
    - Make code as basic as posible, avoid creating magic things.
    - Don't bring design pattern if it's not needed.
- I contribute code with at least 90% code coverage including unit testing and integration testing.
    - I prioritize testing as well as production code.
    - If some bug leaks, I'll find the way to improve how we write the test.
- I also focus on using agile on our development process, this mean at least CI, CD and Automation Testing are mandatory in development process.
- I love functional programming and started using it.

### Customer Management Module
It's a module of Allianz Discovery project. it's a part of CRM module that let agent manage their clients and interact with other modules. I was a backend developer using **Java with Spring Boot**. The interesting things in this project is a restriction of law in some contries don't let us to store customers' sensitive data outside of their contry. So we need to store data in seperate contries. When we fetch or persist data, we need to do it on multiple services. I use **multithreading** to handle this with **RxJava** and an out come performance of this service is awesome.
